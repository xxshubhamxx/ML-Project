# ML-Project

### Problem Statement:

Create a machine learning model that can predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit or not, based on given set of input attributes.



### Dataset Information:

The dataset came from the U. C. Irvine Machine Learning Repository, included data on 41,188 clients across 20 different features, including numeric features (age, days since last contact, etc.) and categorical features (marriage status, job type, degree, etc.). The target variable is a binary "Yes" or "No" (depending on whether the client has subscribed or not).



### Models used:
- kNN
- Multi Layer Perceptron
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- Deep Learning
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- LSTM
- GRU
- XGBoost
- AdaBoost


### Results: 

Best Accuracy Achieved : 91.8%

Model that achieved this accuracy: XGBoost
